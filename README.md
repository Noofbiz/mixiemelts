An e-commerce site I made for a business that never actually happened

It runs on the Google Cloud Platform App Engine Standard Envrionment. It has everything needed in an e-comerce site: a shopping cart, checkout, a database to keep track of inventory, and it linked to PayPal checkout for purchases (that bit isn't here due to potential leaking of keys but is coming soon).
